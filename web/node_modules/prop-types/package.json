  "readme": "# prop-types\n\nRuntime type checking for React props and similar objects.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save prop-types\n```\n\n## Importing\n\n```js\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // ES6\nvar PropTypes = require('prop-types'); // ES5 with npm\n```\n\nIf you prefer a `<script>` tag, you can get it from `window.PropTypes` global:\n\n```html\n<!-- development version -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/prop-types/prop-types.js\"></script>\n \n<!-- production version -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/prop-types/prop-types.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## How to Depend on This Package?\n\nFor apps, we recommend putting it in `dependencies` with a caret range.\nFor example:\n\n```js\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"prop-types\": \"^15.5.0\" \n  }\n```\n\nFor libraries, we *also* recommend leaving it in `dependencies`:\n\n```js\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"prop-types\": \"^15.5.0\" \n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^15.5.0\" \n  }\n```\n\nJust make sure that the version range uses a caret (`^`) and thus is broad enough for npm to efficiently deduplicate packages.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n### React 14\n\nThis package is compatible with **React 0.14.9**. Compared to 0.14.8 (which was released a year ago), there are no other changes in 0.14.9, so it should be a painless upgrade.\n\n```\n# ATTENTION: Only run this if you still use React 0.14!\nnpm install --save react@^0.14.9 react-dom@^0.14.9\n```\n\n### React 15+\n\nThis package is compatible with **React 15.3.0** and higher.\n\n```\nnpm install --save react@^15.3.0 react-dom@^15.3.0\n```\n\n### What happens on other React versions?\n\nIt outputs warnings with the message below even though the developer doesn’t do anything wrong. Unfortunately there is no solution for this other than updating React to either 15.3.0 or higher, or 0.14.9 if you’re using React 0.14.\n\n## Difference from `React.PropTypes`: Don’t Call Validator Functions\n\nFirst of all, **which version of React are you using**? You might be seeing this message because a component library has updated to use `prop-types` package, but your version of React is incompatible with it. See the [above section](#compatibility) for more details.\n\nAre you using either React 0.14.9 or a version higher than React 15.3.0? Read on.\n\nWhen you migrate components to use the standalone `prop-types`, **all validator functions will start throwing an error if you call them directly**. This makes sure that nobody relies on them in production code, and it is safe to strip their implementations to optimize the bundle size.\n\nCode like this is still fine:\n\n```js\nMyComponent.propTypes = {\n  myProp: PropTypes.bool\n};\n```\n\nHowever, code like this will not work with the `prop-types` package:\n\n```js\n// Will not work with `prop-types` package!\nvar errorOrNull = PropTypes.bool(42, 'myProp', 'MyComponent', 'prop');\n```\n\nIt will throw an error:\n\n```\nCalling PropTypes validators directly is not supported by the `prop-types` package.\nUse PropTypes.checkPropTypes() to call them.\n```\n\n(If you see **a warning** rather than an error with this message, please check the [above section about compatibility](#compatibility).)\n\nThis is new behavior, and you will only encounter it when you migrate from `React.PropTypes` to the `prop-types` package. For the vast majority of components, this doesn’t matter, and if you didn’t see [this warning](https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/dont-call-proptypes.html) in your components, your code is safe to migrate. This is not a breaking change in React because you are only opting into this change for a component by explicitly changing your imports to use `prop-types`. If you temporarily need the old behavior, you can keep using `React.PropTypes` until React 16.\n\n**If you absolutely need to trigger the validation manually**, call `PropTypes.checkPropTypes()`. Unlike the validators themselves, this function is safe to call in production, as it will be replaced by an empty function:\n\n```js\n// Works with standalone PropTypes\nPropTypes.checkPropTypes(MyComponent.propTypes, props, 'prop', 'MyComponent');\n```\n\n**You might also see this error** if you’re calling a `PropTypes` validator from your own custom `PropTypes` validator. In this case, the fix is to make sure that you are passing *all* of the arguments to the inner function. There is a more in-depth explanation of how to fix it [on this page](https://facebook.github.io/react/warnings/dont-call-proptypes.html#fixing-the-false-positive-in-third-party-proptypes). Alternatively, you can temporarily keep using `React.PropTypes` until React 16, as it would still only warn in this case.\n\nIf you use a bundler like Browserify or Webpack, don’t forget to [follow these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#development-and-production-versions) to correctly bundle your application in development or production mode. Otherwise you’ll ship unnecessary code to your users.\n\n## Usage\n\nRefer to the [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) for more information.\n\n## Migrating from React.PropTypes\n\nCheck out [Migrating from React.PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html#migrating-from-react.proptypes) for details on how to migrate to `prop-types` from `React.PropTypes`.\n",
